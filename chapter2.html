    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>After a few more minutes of searching, Mr. Hedgehog finally found the stream. He took a big long sip of the cold fresh water and then sat around thinking about what to do next.
        While he sat there thinking, he noticed one of his hedgehog friends further down the stream! He shuffled over to his friend and they talked about their day so far.
        His friend mentioned that some of their hedgehog friends are having a gathering later on during the day to catch up and hang out and Mr. hedgehog gladfully agreed to join. </p>
