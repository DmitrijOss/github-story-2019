    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>Mr Hedgehog was now finally at the gathering, he walked up to all his other hedgehog buddies and they rejoiced!
        He begun to apologize to them about being late, but they refused to listen and were just happy to have him here.
        They then went back to talking amongst themselves and Mr hedghehog went over to his friend that he met with earlier.
        There were refreshments there too with a nice stream being nearby as well as some bugs that the others brought over.
        Mr hedgehog stayed there for a couple more hours enjoying his time and catching up with his friends and acquaintances.</p>

    <p>At one point Mr. Hedgehog realized that it was starting to get late!
        He figured it was time he started going, and begun saying goodbye to all his hedgehog friends.
        After having one quick snack before the road, he set off back to his cozy little tree trunk.
        He enjoyed looking at the sunset on the way back, watching the birds slowly get settled
        into their nests in the trees, watching the other animals head back to their homes alongside him.
