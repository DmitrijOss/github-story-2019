    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>Mr Hedgehog was now finally at the gathering, he walked up to all his other hedgehog buddies and they rejoiced!
        He begun to apologize to them about being late, but they refused to listen and were just happy to have him here.
        They then went back to talking amongst themselves and Mr hedgehog went over to his friend that he met with earlier.
        There were refreshments there too with a nice stream being nearby as well as some bugs that the others brought over.
        Mr hedgehog stayed there for a couple more hours enjoying his time and catching up with his friends and acquaintances.</p>

    <p>At one point Mr. Hedgehog realized that it was starting to get late!
        He figured it was time he started going, and begun saying goodbye to all his hedgehog friends.
        His friends however had different plans! They were having such a great time that they didn't want to leave.
        They were planning to stay at their friend Hubert's burrow, as it was very spacious and could easily fit most of them there.
        Mr. hedgehog was a fan of sleepovers so he quickly agreed to the idea.
        The hedgehogs then began to clean everything up to get ready to leave to Hubert's house.
    </p>

    <p>        When the hedgehogs had cleaned the place up they were finally ready to go.
        Hubert's burrow was nearby so it was only a short journey there.
        It was already dark at this point, but Mr hedgehog didn't mind as he had all his friends with him.
        When they finally arrived at the burrow, Mr hedgehog was in awe!
        He has never seen a home as big as this one. They all made their way inside and found a nice spot to sleep in.
        They talked until the early hours in the morning, as they were having too good of a time to go to sleep.
        One by one however, Mr hedgehogs fell asleep, and so Mr hedgehog decided that he too should go to sleep.
        So he told his friends good night, and closed his eyes, feeling happy over how his day had went.
