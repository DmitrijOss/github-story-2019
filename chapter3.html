    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>Mr Hedgehog was now finally at the gathering, he walked up to all his other hedgehog buddies and they rejoiced!
        He begun to apologize to them about being late, but they refused to listen and were just happy to have him here.
        They then went back to talking amongst themselves and Mr hedghehog went over to his friend that he met with earlier.
        There were refreshments there too with a nice stream being nearby as well as some bugs that the others brought over.
        Mr hedgehog stayed there for a couple more hours enjoying his time and catching up with his friends and acquaintances.</p>
