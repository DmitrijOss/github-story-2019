    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>After a few more minutes of searching, Mr. Hedgehog finally found the stream. He took a big long sip of the cold fresh water and then sat around thinking about what to do next.
        While he sat there thinking, he noticed one of his hedgehog friends further down the stream! He shuffled over to his friend and they talked about their day so far.
        His friend mentioned that some of their hedgehog friends are having a gathering later on during the day to catch up and hang out and Mr. hedgehog gladfully agreed to join. </p>

    <p>They said goodbye to each other for now and went their separate ways, agreeing to meet up with each other later on.
        Mr. Hedgehog, now fed and not thirsty anymore decided to just go for a walk around the forest. He saw many pretty flowers blooming, with lots of different colours.
        The trees were beginning to turn green again with all their leaves sprouting. “What a beautiful time of the year” he thought to himself.
        While walking around, he saw a family of squirrels gathering acorns for dinner, and a small group of friendly rabbits.
