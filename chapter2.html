    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>After a few more minutes of searching, Mr. Hedgehog finally found the stream. He took a big long sip of the cold fresh water and then sat around thinking about what to do next.
        While he sat there thinking, he noticed one of his hedgehog friends further down the stream! He shuffled over to his friend and they talked about their day so far.
        His friend mentioned that some of their hedgehog friends are having a gathering later on during the day to catch up and hang out and Mr. hedgehog gladfully agreed to join. </p>

    <p>They said goodbye to each other for now and went their separate ways, agreeing to meet up with each other later on.
        Mr. Hedgehog, now fed and not thirsty anymore decided to just go for a walk around the forest. He saw many pretty flowers blooming, with lots of different colours.
        The trees were beginning to turn green again with all their leaves sprouting. “What a beautiful time of the year” he thought to himself.
        While walking around, he saw a family of squirrels gathering acorns for dinner, and a small group of friendly rabbits.
    </p>

    <p>After a few hours, Mr. Hedgehog noticed that the sun was slowly beginning to set. He realized it was probably time to slowly get going over to the gathering, but he realized he was lost!
        He had walked a bit too far into unfamiliar territory and didn't know how to get back. He wandered around looking for any familiar landmarks but could find none.
        At this point, Mr hedgehog was starting to feel scared, worrying that he wouldn't be able to find his way back before sunset, but just as he was beginning to worry he saw a shadow towering over him.
        He turned around and saw a majestic moose! The Moose asked him if Mr. Hedgehog was okay, as he looked frightened. Mr. hedgehog asked him if he could help him find his was back and he agreed.
        The Moose knew the forest well, and was able to easily lead Mr. Hedgehog right to where the gathering was! He thanked the Moose and they went their seperate ways.
