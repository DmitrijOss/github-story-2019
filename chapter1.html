    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <p>On one early Spring morning, Mr. Hedgehog found himself waking up in his cozy bed of leaves after spending a long and cold winter hibernating.
        He opened his eyes and saw that everything was just the way he had left it. He let out a big yawn and got up out of his bed,
        excited to see what's new and what's changed while he was asleep.</p>

    <p>He stepped out into the beautiful morning outdoors, breathing in the fresh air for the first time in what felt like forver.
        The sun was only just rising in the sky, and the forest was slowly waking up alongside him.
        he could hear some familiar bird-calls in the distance, and saw one of the squirrels that has been around as long as he has!
        He then went off in search of some bugs to eat because he was very hungry after that 5 month long nap.</p>
